The Distraqt project files generally mirror the final project files though prefixed with the convention 'd_*' or 'distraqt_*'.

---------------------------
1. Clone the repo

2. (optional) run the file 'lotsOfDistraqt.py' to generate mock data
navigate to the directory named 'catalog'
>>> python lotsOfDistraqt.py

3. run the file 'distraqt_finalProject.py' directly
>>> python distraqt_finalProject.py
you should see the server running, returning something like:

Or you can run this via heroku local web
>>> heroku local web
you should see the server running, returning something like:
9:32:59 PM web.1 |   * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
