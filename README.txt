Distraqt Final Project:
-----------------------

This project is based on Udacity's full stack nanodegree.
There are two versions - one for the restaurant menu app and one for the final project, called 'Distraqt'. The files prefixed with the convention 'd_*' or 'distraqt_*' indicate they are part of the Distraqt final project. Admittedly this is not the most intuitive way to organize this - when time permits this repo will be restructured and the README will reflect those updates. 


Running the Final Project:
---------------------------
1. Clone the repo

2. (optional) run the file 'lotsOfDistraqt.py' to generate mock data
navigate to the directory named 'catalog'
>>> python lotsOfDistraqt.py

3. run the file 'distraqt_finalProject.py' directly
>>> python distraqt_finalProject.py
you should see the server running, returning something like:
http://0.0.0.0:33507/
Or you can run this via heroku local web
>>> heroku local web
you should see the server running, returning something like:
9:32:59 PM web.1 |   * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
9:32:59 PM web.1 |   * Restarting with reloader

4. from here you should be able to navigate to the app.
